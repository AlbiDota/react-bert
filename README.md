##  REACTJS PRACTICE 
### Having fun and goofing around :DD 

Welcome to **react-bert**! 🎉   
This is a hobby project where I make some not-so-complicated React components.
This is all made for fun, and for learning JavaScript, React, Html, CSS and firebase.

🔗 **Live Version:** [react-bert.web.app](https://react-bert.web.app/) (Hosted on **Firebase**)

## Want to Run My React App Locally?    

1️⃣ Clone the repo:  
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/AlbiDota/react-bert
```  

2️⃣ Navigate into the project:  
```cmd
cd react-bert
```  

3️⃣ Install dependencies:  
```cmd
npm install
```  

 _If you run into missing dependencies, install them manually using:_  
```cmd
npm install <package-name>
```  
or just try:  
```cmd
npm install --force
```  
(This might fix things, but also might break the universe. Use wisely.)  

4️⃣ Start the app:  
```cmd
npm start
```
